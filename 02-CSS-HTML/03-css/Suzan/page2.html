    <p class="p1">The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the 
        Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. 
        Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger 
        Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération 
        Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, 
        they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf Spitz").
