            <p class="p1">Nazareth is the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as "the Arab capital of Israel".
                In 2019 its population was 77,445. 
                The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, 
                of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. 
                Nof HaGalil (formerly "Nazareth Illit"), declared a separate city in June 1974, 
                is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">In the New Testament, the town is described as the childhood home of Jesus, and as such is a center of Christian pilgrimage,
                with many shrines commemorating biblical events.

            <h2>A little about its history</h2>
            <h4>Stone Age</h4>
            <p class="p1">Archaeological researchers have revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh, about two miles (3.2 km) from current Nazareth, dates back roughly 9000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era.[41] The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Bronze and Iron Age</h4>
            <p class="p1">The Franciscan priest Bellarmino Bagatti, "Director of Christian Archaeology", carried out extensive excavation of this "Venerated Area" from 1955 to 1965. Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Roman period</h4>
            <p class="p1">Archaeological evidence shows the Nazareth was occupied during the late Hellenistic period, through the Roman period and into the Byzantine period.
                <br>
                According to the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth was the home village of Mary as well as the site of the Annunciation (when the angel Gabriel informed Mary that she would give birth to Jesus). According to the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph and Mary resettled in Nazareth after returning from the flight from Bethlehem to Egypt. According to the Bible, Jesus grew up in Nazareth from some point in his childhood. However, some modern scholars also regard Nazareth as the birthplace of Jesus.
            </p>
            <h4>Byzantine period</h4>
            <p>Epiphanius in his Panarion (c. AD 375) numbers Nazareth among the cities devoid of a non-Jewish population.[60] Epiphanius, writing of Joseph of Tiberias, a wealthy Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of Constantine, says he claimed to have received an imperial rescript to build Christian churches in Jewish towns and villages where no gentiles or Samaritans dwell, naming Tiberias, Diocaesarea, Sepphoris, Nazareth and Capernaum.[61] From this scarce notice, it has been concluded that a small church which encompassed a cave complex might have been located in Nazareth in the early 4th century,"[62] although the town was Jewish until the 7th century</p>
