    <p>Aiman Younis, 25 years old from Arara village , Here is some information about my village:</p>
    <p>Ar'ara (Arabic: عرعرة, Hebrew: עַרְעָרָה; lit. "Juniper tree")[2] is an Arab town in the Wadi Ara region in northern Israel. It is located south of
         Umm al-Fahm just northwest of the Green Line, and is part of the Triangle. In 2019, the population was 25,245.[1]

    <h2>History : Persian to Mamluk periods </h2>
        <p>Pottery sherds from Persian period have been found here.[3]

            Burial complexes from the Roman period have been excavated at Ar'ara, revealing clay lamps, glass vessels and beads, commonly used in the 1st to 4th century CE.[4] Rock-cut tombs with niches, and Byzantine period ceramics have been found.[5]
            
            In the Crusader period, the place was known as "Castellum Arearum". In the land allocation made by sultan Baybars in 663 H. (1265-1266 C.E.), Ar'ara was shared between his amirs Ala' al-Din and Sayf al-Din Bayhaq al-Baghdadi.[6]
            
            A few clay fragments from the Mamluk period have been found at the same location as the Roman remains.[4]
